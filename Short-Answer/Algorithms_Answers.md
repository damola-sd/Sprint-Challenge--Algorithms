#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The time complexity is O(n). This is because the code runs for constant time depending on the value of n


b) This has tiime complexity of O(n^2). This is because there are two nested loops depending on the valie of n


c) Recursion with base condition set at 0. Works the number of the variable bunnies is insrted. O(n)

## Exercise II

I would check the middle floor of the building n/2.
Drop an egg from that floor.
If the egg breaks, go a floor lower until you get to the floor where the egg doesn't break.
Return the value f of that floor
If it doesn't break, go higher by a floor until you get to a floor where the egg breaks for the first time.
Then go back down by one floor. 
return the value f of that floor.
